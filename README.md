# Vim Course
Vim isn't easy to learn and the internet has a lot of content about how to
start and how to build your first Vim config (more on that later).
That's why, in this course we'll focus on answering two questions: 

- Why a technology from the 90s is still a good option for software development?
- Why should I give a try?

To answer this question, we will see a introduction to Vim, how a fully
customizable vim looks like (config + plugins), and how to integrate 
your workflow with TMUX.

> Yes, you'll learn how to exit vim.
