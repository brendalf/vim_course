# Vim Course

Welcome to my vim course.

## Before Start 

Vim isn't easy to learn.  
Vim is like a instrument, you need to develop muscle memory.

## Objectives

The goal is to answer why a technology from the 90s is still a good option for
software development and why should you give it a try?

> If you want to learn how to customize your Vim or how to learn more about it,
> this isn't the course for you. The internet is full of good content for this
> and there are some links that can help you in the last chapter.

## Keep in mind

* Don't try to memorize everything, it's impossible.
* Try to see this with an open mind.
* The way to learn vim is by learning each command at a time.

## Accomplishments

In the end, you should be able to:
* **EXIT** vim.
* Navigate on vim and do simple things.

Also, you should understand:
* The power of vim and why your productivity will increase.
* How you can combine plugins and tmux to improve your workflow even more.

## Summary

* What is Vim?   
* Why Vim?   
* Integrating with Tmux  
* Next Steps  
* Q&A   

## Who am I
* I started learning how to code a long time ago, so I already used a lot of
IDEs and Text Editors, like:  
> Atom, Sublime, Gedit, Notepad++, Adobe Dreamwave, Visual Studio,
> Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA (and variants), Netbeans, CodeBlocks,
> Brackets, and Visual Studio Code (since the release in 2015).
* I'm a Linux user since 2009 and after the first two years using it, I already
had lost count of how many  times I couldn't exit vim, so I decided  to learn 
more about it.
* Since 2020 I decided to start using vim as my default editor, instead of using just to edit small things.
