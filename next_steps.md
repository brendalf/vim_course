# Next Steps

Here are some tips and content that I would recommend to anyone that wants to learn Vim.

* VimTutor: `vimtutor`
* VimAdventurer (Learn by Playing): https://vim-adventures.com/
* Vim CheatSheet: https://vim.rtorr.com/lang/pt_br
* ThePrimeagen: https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen
* Mastering the Vim Language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0
* vim + tmux: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r6yzFEXajQ

## VSCode + Vim

The VSCode has a plugin which give us some basic vim features, like vim modes 
and configs.

This is the easiest way to learn how to navigate with vim before fully migrating. 

To install, search for "vim" in the plugin manager.

## Configure your Vim 

If you want to learn Vim/Neovim and build your own config, here are some extra 
YouTube channels that I like:

* ThePrimeagen (AGAIN): https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen
* DistroTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg
* Nick Janetakis: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorzANoC3fX9VVefJHM5wtA 
* devaslife: https://www.youtube.com/c/devaslife
* NeoVim Core Developer: https://www.twitch.tv/teej_dv

## Extra:

**Newer versions of Neovim**
Many changes were introduced in Neovim v0.5.0 and old configuration were
deprecated.

If you want to start learning, start with the newest version.

All my configuration was built before this new version and this has kept me
from using some newer plugins, like Telescope.

**spacevim / spacemacs**
You should definetly check out these two projects.
