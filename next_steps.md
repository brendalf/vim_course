## VSCode + Vim Integration
The VSCode has a plugin called Vim which give us some basic vim features,
like vim modes and configs. I think this is the easiest way to learn how to
navigate with vim before migrating to it. 

To install, search for "vim" in the plugin manager.

## Building Your Onw Configuration
If you want to learn Vim/Neovim and build your own config, here are some extra 
YouTube channels that I like:
- ThePrimeagen (AGAIN): https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen
- Nick Janetakis: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorzANoC3fX9VVefJHM5wtA 
- devaslife: https://www.youtube.com/c/devaslife
- NeoVim Core Developer: https://www.twitch.tv/teej_dv

### Things to keep in mind:

**Newer versions of Neovim**
Many changes were introduced in Neovim v0.5.0 and old configuration were
deprecated. If you want to start learning, start with the newest version.
All my configuration was built before this new version and this has kept me
from using some newer plugins, like Telescope.

**spacevim / spacemacs**
You should definetly check out these two projects.
