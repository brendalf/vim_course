# Why Vim?

As programmers, we're quite often working on the terminal and/or over a ssh
sessions, without GUI.

In these situations we usually have to edit files but we don't have an IDEs. 

Vim is portable and it's present in almost every UNIX distro, so doesn't
matter where we are, we probably have vim there ready to be used.

Vim can do a lot more than just openning, changing, and saving a file.

This is already a good option of why you must learn vim.

## Going deeper

**Why should I use vim as my default text editor?**
Because it will increase your productivity.

But this is something that just talking isn't going to change your mind.
You need to see for yourself.

After all, it's just another text editor, right?

So unfortunately, I can't answer this question for you.

**What I can do is to show you why**:
* My productivity has increased.
* Now I hate to use anything else.
* You should at least give it a try.

## Just an editor?

After learning vim you realize that other text editors or IDEs aren't made to
edit text.

> WHAAAT??

The reason for this is that all editors only have the insert mode.
Every time you open a file, you're ready to insert.

If you pay attention to what you do while coding, you'll realize that most of
the time, you are reading code and navigating through files and methods.

So, in other editors you are constantly using your mouse, loosing productivity.

Vim has more modes than just the insert mode, which gives layers to your
keyboard, enabling you to do everything without taking the hands from it.
