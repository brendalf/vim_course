# What is Neovim?
It's a fork from Vim that is maintained by the community.
Because of that, neovim has actually more features than Vim and all of the 
new features of Vim were first introduced in Neovim.
Neovim is multi thread.

> Vim doesn't want to become the next Vi.

One of these features is the Search+Replace highlight.
