# Why Vim?
Unfortunately, what I can do is to answer why vim is the best editor for me, 
and why you should learn it.

First of all, as software engineers, we're quite often working in the terminal
and/or ssh sessions, without GUI. In these environments you probably already
had to edit a file in some terminal based editor. 

Most of the times you can't port your editor to there and knowing vim will help
you. This is already a good option of why you must learn how to do basic things
on vim.

## Why I should use vim as my default editor?
Because it will increase your productivity, simple as that.

To answer this question, we first need to understand that programming is more
than just editing files. 80% of the time you are reading code, going through
the file, jumping into methods definitions, going back, and etc.
It's in these use cases that vim can help you the most.

The newer text editor / IDEs aren't made for this. You have to always leave the
hands from the keyboard, loosing time.

Even when we start writing, vim is still faster because we usually don't write
full blocks of code.

The whole productivity of vim comes from vim modes, let's jump into that.
