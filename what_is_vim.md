## History

Vim stands for **V**i **IM**proved and was released on 1991 by Bram Moolenar.
Vim is based on its predecessor Vi, released on 1967 by Bill Joy.

> Initially Vim was an acronym for Vi IMitation.

## Pros

**Vim Script**
Vim has it's own programming language. With this language you can build your
own macros, functions and/or plugins.

**Plugins**
Vim has the largest number of plugins because of its community is old and huge.

## Cons

Vim is a single thread application and despite being open source, it's
maintained mainly by its creator until today.

# Neovim?
It's a fork from Vim that is maintained by the community.
Because of that, neovim has more features than Vim. 

Neovim is multi thread, which makes it more suitable for today processors.

Vim doesn't want to become the next Vi, so Vim is implementing new features
that were first introduced in Neovim.

One of these features is the Search+Replace highlight:
`:%s/`
